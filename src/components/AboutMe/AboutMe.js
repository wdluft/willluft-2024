      <p>
        I work for{' '}
        <a href='https://www.donorschoose.org/'>DonorsChoose</a> on
        the Information and Business Technology team, primarily making
        sure our procure-to-pay processes all run smoothly.

        In 2021, I needed to get a gift for my wife for our
        anniversary. I made her a leather bag from a kit, enjoying the
        process so much that I dove head first into leathercraft. I
        love working with leather, where I make belts, card holders,
        key chains, valet trays, and more.

        I enjoy playing and watching sports - getting out and playing
        soccer or volleyball at least once a week. You can also often
        find me cheering for my favorite teams: Chelsea FC, the Green
        Bay Packers, and the New York Islanders.
